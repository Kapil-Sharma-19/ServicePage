# Contributing Guidelines


## Steps to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository.** This creates your own copy of the repository where you can make your changes.

2. **Clone the repository to your local machine.** This allows you to work on the changes on your own machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
    ```

3. **Create a new branch.** This keeps your changes separate from the main project until you're ready to merge them in.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```

4. **Make your changes.** Do the work you'd like to contribute.

5. **Commit your changes.** This saves your changes into your own repository.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Description of changes made"
    ```

6. **Push your changes to your fork.** This uploads your changes to GitHub.

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

7. **Create a pull request.** This notifies the project that you have some changes that you'd like to contribute.
